Ghostbusters Belt Gizmo

500+$ for a belt gizmo is very expensive these days. I co-designed the functional board to work with this wonderful 3d printable piece: https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/gadget/ghostbusters-belt-gizmo I definitly recommend the upgraded one: https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/gadget/ghostbusters-ultimate-belt-gizmo-with-daughter-bard and of course: https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/gadget/ghostbusters-ultimate-belt-gizmo-with-daughter-bard [I'm using this one] the code is WIP! please contribute and post back your improvements.

This project is free for all.
